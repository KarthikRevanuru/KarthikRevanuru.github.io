* *Efficient Sketching Algorithm for Sparse Binary Data.* Rameshwar Pratap, Debajyoti Bera and **Karthik Revanuru**. In ICDM 2019:IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (< 9 % acceptance rate). [Paper](../assets/documents/ICDM2019-Binsketch.pdf){:target="_blank"}

* *Neural Machine Translation of Indian Languages.* **Karthik Revanuru** , Kaushik Turlapaty, and Shrisha Rao. In Compute ’17: 10th Annual ACM India Compute Conference, November 16–18, 2017. [Paper](../assets/documents/p12-revanuru.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [Slides](../assets/documents/p12-revanuru-slides.pdf){:target="_blank"}

* *Fully Automatic Brain Tumour Segmentation using Random Forests and Patient survival prediction using XGBoost.* **Karthik Revanuru** , and Nameeta Shah. In 2017 International MICCAI BraTS Challenge, September 14, 2017. [Pre Conference Proceedings](https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/sbia/Spyridon.Bakas/MICCAI_BraTS/MICCAI_BraTS_2017_proceedings_shortPapers.pdf){:target="_blank"}

* *FastEmb: Faster Succinct and Accurate Embedding for Large Network.* **Karthik Revanuru**, Rameshwar Pratap, Debajyoti Bera, Tanmoy Chakraborty, and Raghav Kulkarni. (Under Review) Extended BinSketch to create graph embeddings which can be used for evaluation of several downstream evaluation tasks. FastEmb performs better than existing methods like Node2Vec, Deepwalk and it's 100's of times faster. 

* *Randomness Efficient Feature Hashing for Sparse Binary Data.* Rameshwar Pratap, **Karthik Revanru**, Anirudh Ravi and Raghav Kulkarni.  (Under Review) Proposed a new hashing algorithm which reduces randomness to logrithmic in dimension while maintaining accuracy similar to existing methods like Minhash and Simhash.

* *Cosine Similarity Preserving Compression for Sparse Binary Data.* Rameshwar Pratap, **Karthik Revanru**, Anirudh Ravi and Raghav Kulkarni. (Under Review)
