# Projects 
1. ## Quora Question Pairs
... Thousands of new questions are posted in Quora everyday. In order to build a highquality knowledge base,it’s important to ensure each unique question exists on Quora only once. Writers shouldn’t have to write the same answer to multiple versions of the same question, and readers should be able to find a single canonical page with the question they’re looking for. In this project we applied Statistical Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches to the problem of semantic matching on questions asked in Quora. Our model had an accuracy of 82 Percent.

2. ## Automatic Shot Detection in Cricket
... We have detected four types of cricket shots namely Straight Drive, Cover Drive, Pull shot and Cut Shot in Cricket. Our HMM based model has an accuracy of 80 percent and we are currently working on rating these shots and give some feedback based on how good was the shot played.

3. ## Speed Dating Analytics
...Performed Business Understanding, Descriptive Analytics, Cluster Analytics, Predictive Analytics using Classification and Association rules on a Speed Dating Experiment Dataset form Kaggle.

4. ## Electronic Health Record
...A digital version of a patient's paper chart. This is real-time, patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users.

5. ## Smart Neighborhood
...Built a social media platform centered around the idea to encapsulate the concept of a neighborhood where members in a neighborhood can convey and retrieve essential information efficiently. Built using Ruby on Rails.

6. ## Heart Rate Detection using ECG Signal
...Wrote an efficient program in C++ and GNU Octave that takes raw ECG signal as input and detects and plots the R peaks from the QRS complex present in the signal using Fast Fourier Transform, High Pass Filtering and a Dynamic Sliding Window heuristic.

7. ## Spectral Analysis of Accelerometer Data
...Use an Accelerometer to collect data during different activities such as jogging, walking, climbing stairs up/down, running ,riding a bus and provide the spectral analysis from accelerometer signal collected.

8. ## Pedometer
...Built a Pedometer that uses gy521 sensor and Arduino. It counts the number of steps you take. It uses accelerometer and gyroscope to measure the steps.

9. ## Locate Me- Disaster Relief App
...Two apps, one used by users which collects user location and the other used by authorities in case of a disaster where it will determine the last known location of victims.

10. ## Driverless cars
...Developed a simulation for Driver-less cars which reflects real world traffic in Java.

11. ## Virtual File System
...Implemented a basic Virtual File System to store and retrieve files and folders in C++

12. ## Question Box
...Developed a chat system using TCP/IP protocol for asking questions to a teacher during lecture.

13. ## Snail Mail Notifier
...Developed as a part of Basic electronics project a device which notifies when you get a Newspaper, Milk, Letters with different sounds.

14. ## Adding New Instruction to Simple Scalar
...Added a new instruction to simple scalar PISA architecture and analyzed it's performance on a set of benchmark programs.

15. ## Digital Communication
...Simulated signal transfer over binary error erasure symmetric and AWGN channel of compressed (Discrete Cosine Transform, LZW, Huffman) and encoded (BCH/cyclic codes) music files (.wav).

16. ## Operating Systems
...Implemented OS Scheduling Policies (FCFS, SJF, HRRN, Priority, RR, SRTN) in C. Created a shell in Ubuntu using C.

17. ## Implementation of Common Algorithms
...Face detection, Matrix processing library, Huffman compression in Python, Sudoku solver using graph theory, Perfect hashing, Rabin-Karp string matching.
