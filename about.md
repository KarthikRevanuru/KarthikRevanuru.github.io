Hello, I'm Karthik Revanuru and I currently work with[CRED](https://www.cred.club/) in Data Science.

In the past, I've worked with multiple startups and MNC's in full time and consulting roles, where I designed and developed multiple AI products. Some of these include [SPARTA](https://sparta.aero/) back-office document processing using AI,  a content filter for a social network, a voice assistant(customer support bot) for an automotive dealership, on the edge(without internet) video activity detector, precision agriculture product which predicts harvest and gives various alerts. 

My research interests are in Machine Learning and AI. I'm always on the lookout for research opportunities. My recent works are in Large Scale Machine Learning using Location Sensitive hashing. I've been fortunate to work and learn from [Rameshwar Pratap](https://sites.google.com/site/prataprameshwaryadav/home), [Tanmoy Chakraborty](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~tanmoy/), [Debajyoti Bera](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/dbera), and [Shrisha Rao](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/shrisha-rao). My long term research goal is to work in Quantum AI and Data Storage using Artificial DNA. Feel free to look into [Research](https://karthikrevanuru.github.io/research/) for more details. 

I graduated from [IIITB](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/) with Integrated Masters in Computer Science with a thesis in Activity Recognition. I've worked with [Dr Nameeta Shah](https://www.msctr.org/2016/09/16/dr-nameeta-shah/){:target="_blank"}, on Multi-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation at *Mazumdar Shah Center for Translational Research*
